# Anomaly Detection in Credit Card Transactions

### Overview
This project presents a deep learning-based approach for anomaly detection in credit card transactions. The proposed method utilizes a transformer-based autoencoder, discriminator, and contrastive learning model to detect fraudulent transactions.

### Methodology
Data exploration and preprocessing
Data augmentation with geometric distribution mask
Transformer autoencoder for anomaly detection
Discriminator for binary classification
Contrastive learning model for robust representations
Comparison with traditional methods (PCA, OneClassSVM, Isolation Forest, Local Outlier Factor, DBSCAN, Dynamic Time Warping)

### Evaluation
F1 score for anomaly detection accuracy
Execution time for computational efficiency

### Results
Deep learning-based approach outperforms traditional methods
Transformer autoencoder achieves superior F1 scores
